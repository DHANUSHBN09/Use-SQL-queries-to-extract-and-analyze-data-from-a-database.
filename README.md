Task 3 - SQL for Data Analysis (Ecommerce)
=========================================


- ecommerce.db          : SQLite database with synthetic ecommerce data
- queries.sql           : SQL queries file (10 example queries demonstrating required concepts)
- query_01.csv/.png ... : Outputs for each query (CSV + PNG screenshot)


How to run:
- Open the SQLite DB (e.g., with sqlite3 CLI or DB browser) or run the queries in queries.sql.
- The PNG files are simple screenshots of the query outputs; CSV files contain raw result data.

Queries included showcase:
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING
- INNER/LEFT JOIN examples
- Subqueries (including correlated)
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
- Views and index creation
- Window function example
- Creating a view and an index to optimize queries

Notes:
- This is a small synthetic dataset for demonstration. For real datasets, replace ecommerce.db with your database.
- If you want, I can adapt these queries to MySQL/Postgres dialects and produce screenshots from those systems.
